# Decision-tree-project-1
In this lab exercise, I used a popular machine learning algorithm, Decision Trees. I used this classification algorithm to build a model from the historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. Then i used the trained decision tree to predict the class of an unknown patient and to find a proper drug for a new patient.
